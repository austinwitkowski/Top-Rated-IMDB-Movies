This is an analysis I did of a dataset about IMDB Movies Ratings I found on Kaggle, using SQL. 
Through my analysis, I discovered that the most popular film genre since 1902 has been drama. I also learned that English has been the most common langauge filmed, as well as 2018 being the most popular year for movie releases.

My findings are displayed here on Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/austin.witkowski/viz/IMDBMovieRatings_17164961283680/Dashboard1

The original dataset is called "IMDB Top Rated Movies Dataset" created by Shubham Maindola: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammaindola/tmdb-top-rated-movies-dataset
